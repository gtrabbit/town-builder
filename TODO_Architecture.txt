    ============== Present Tasks =============

TODO: 

    
    Click listener on the map layer to close the infoWindow if it is open
    buildings can only be placed on certain terrain types



    Tech tree
        --buildings required to unlock upgrades
        --buildings will need a concept of requirements for being built --done, maybe with a refactor to use a config object rather than a callback?
        --non-linear tech-tree for citizen upgrades
            --side effect is that this will push for incorporating even more territory

    Incorporate art assets



    =========== Ideas / Future ==========


Need to move on toward enabling the upgrading of citizens

daily/random events

hint/advice feature on announcements page

Consider migrating to an actual build system (webpack/babel w/ Grunt?) -- thus, an npm background, which will need to come eventually anyway if we're going to have persistence
    AMD To ES5/6 npm plugin would be very helpful.

Build UI components --- I suppose I should wait on Barry before I bother with that, though? yes. everything can look like crap for now.
                        but down the road, I should definitely abstract UI into reusable/atomic classes


    ============= Saving ============

-- want to minimize the amount of data needed to regenerate the exact game state.
-- need not pass any logic

-- if we want to consider saving a possibility, then we will need the game object to be able to track which events have triggered / how many times.
--Wire up with firebase or using cookies?
